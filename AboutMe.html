<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a freelance designer, I am continually developing and honing my skills in branding, creating logos and coding. I am proficient in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, coding HTML, and CSS. I focus on the utilization of white space, text and minimal design, which I feel to be the future of artistry. I want to bring forth my style while creating strong and impactful designs catered to each client and brand's digital media needs. In my spare time, I enjoy the challenge of hiking mountains and capturing photographs of the peaceful landscape at the summit. If not hiking, you will find me on the court engaged in competitive volleyball or browsing the web staring at sneakers.</p>
